# cryptocurrency-evaluator
A crypto currency evaluator I made a few years ago. 
Using this script, you can predict with some accuracy how much a crypto currency is valued (in Bitcoin) by comparing to the leading crypto currency that utilises the same hashing mechanism. It works quiet simply by querying the blockchain explorer for the crypto crypto currencies specified and pulling the network hash-rate. Then the value of the currency in a market of your choice.
More details and development will continue in the upcomming days. I have no idea if this still works, but it was a very usefull tool.
